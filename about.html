          <h3>My Upbringing</h3>
          <p>I grew up in Norwalk, California, where I still live today. Much of my childhood was spent outdoors, playing with the friends I made in the same apartment complex. Those days were full of laughter, adventure, and meaningful memories that I’ll always cherish. As I’ve grown older, I often reflect on those simpler times and find myself wishing I could return to a period when life felt carefree and full of wonder.</p>
          <p>These early experiences helped shape who I am today. One value that stands out is loyalty — something I take great pride in. However, I’ve come to learn that loyalty can be both a strength and a vulnerability. While I stand by those I care about, I’ve also had to learn the hard way that not everyone is deserving of that loyalty. Still, it remains a part of my character that I continue to embrace and better understand.</p>

          <h3>Personal Background</h3>
          <p>I was born and raised in Norwalk, California. My dad is from El Salvador and my mom is from Mexico. I'm the youngest of three siblings. My sister is the oldest — we’re about eight years apart — and my brother, the middle child, is just about a year and a half older than me. Growing up with older siblings has shaped me in many ways and has played a big role in who I’ve become. My family has always supported both my academic goals and my creative pursuits, and their influence continues to guide me today.</p>
          <p>I’m deeply motivated by my family and friends. They’ve always believed in me, and I want to make them proud. My ultimate goal is to be in a position where I can financially take care of all my loved ones and also support others in need. Knowing that my success could someday bring comfort and opportunity to those around me keeps me pushing forward every day.</p>

          <h3>My Fitness Journey</h3>
          <p>I started working out in February 2021, right around the end of the lockdown. Before the pandemic, I worked as a busser on weekends — a job that was physically demanding and left me sore and exhausted all week, just in time to start over again. When the pandemic hit, I lost that job and became very inactive, which left me out of shape and unmotivated.</p>
          <p>When a coworker asked for help in February 2021, I decided to return to work — but this time, I wanted to be better prepared. A week before starting, I began exercising at my friend’s home gym. After about two weeks, I had outgrown the setup and signed up for a gym membership in late April. From then until August, I was consistent and made noticeable progress.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, in August I suffered a bench press injury that forced me to take about a month and a half off. Although I was lucky it wasn’t too serious, getting back into a consistent rhythm afterward was tough. From then until July 2024, I struggled with motivation and was on-and-off at the gym, sometimes going entire months without a single visit.</p>
          <p>By August 2024, I found myself in the worst shape I had ever been. That moment sparked a change — I committed to a new routine, started a proper diet, and refocused my goals. I dropped 18 pounds and have spent the last five months successfully maintaining my weight. Fitness has now become more than a routine — it's a part of my lifestyle and a source of pride and self-discipline.</p>
